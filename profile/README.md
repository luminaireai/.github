# Interpretation of Facts
We are a group of scientists focused on extracting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing information. We aim to extract & transform public, convoluted information and make it available to a broad audience via comprehensive visualizations & studies, letting them discriminate what is being provided by always citing the primary resources we employ. Hence, we aim to provide the most impartial information possible without giving any potential interpretation or misinterpretation.
